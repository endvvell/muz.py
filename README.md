# mu.py
Anki-like program to learn music theory by heart.

The values for tones, notes, and scales are determined algorithmically, meaning there is no stored value for, say 4th tone of D♯ Minor scale (G♯), but instead the algorithm goes through the list of all semi-tones in an octave and detirmines that value. This should make this script easily extendable to the entirety of music theory.
Right now the script is useful for learning all the different tones of any scale, so that playing music becomes intuitive. I will be adding other aspects of music theory later on.
